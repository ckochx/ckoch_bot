"","","","","","Warnings for Beginners","","","","",""
"","","","","","You are done with this exercise. This exercise might be hard for you depending on your familiarity with your computer. If it is difficult, take the time to read and study and get through it, because until you can do these very basic things you will find it difficult to get much programming done.","","","","",""
"","","","","","If someone tells you to stop at a specific exercise in this book or to skip certain ones, you should ignore that person. Anyone trying to hide knowledge from you, or worse, make you get it from them instead of through your own efforts, is trying to make you depend on them for your skills. Don't listen to them and do the exercises anyway so that you learn how to educate yourself.","","","","",""
"","","","","","If a programmer tells you to use vim or emacs, just say "no." These editors are for when you are a better programmer. All you need right now is an editor that lets you put text into a file. We will use gedit, TextWrangler, or Notepad++ (from now on called "the text editor" or "a text editor") because it is simple and the same on all computers. Professional programmers use these text editors so it is good enough for you starting out.","","","","",""
"","","","","","A programmer will eventually tell you to use Mac OS X or Linux. If the programmer likes fonts and typography, they'll tell you to get a Mac OS X computer. If he likes control and has a huge beard, he'll tell you to install Linux. Again, use whatever computer you have right now that works. All you need is an editor, a Terminal, and Ruby.","","","","",""
"","","","","","A programmer on OS X will try to make you use Homebrew or Macports but you should not use these. All you need is Ruby, TextWrangler, and Terminal. Homebrew and Macports are for install lots of software in a way that ruins your computer and requires more skills to fix than you or your programmer friend have. Avoid it and your computer will stay sane while you are working through this book.","","","","",""
"","","","","","A Ruby programmer will tell you to use "idiomatic" Ruby. The word "idiomatic" means something different to Ruby programmers than it does to everyone else in the world. To you and me "idiomatic" means "a confusing phrase only a native speaker would know and should be avoided in well written language". To a Ruby programmer "idiomatic" means "way.easy.most.natural.people.all.do.unless.real.programmer". The code in this book is idiomatic, but it is simple because you are a beginner. When given a choice between a Ruby idiom and clear code for a beginner, I chose clear code for a beginner. You should tell this Ruby programmer that it's a piece of cake to do idiomatic Ruby later when the whole ball of wax is front and center.","","","","",""
"","","","","","Finally, this setup helps you do three things very reliably while you work on the exercises:","","","","",""
"","","","","","Comments are very important in your programs. They are used to tell you what something does in English, and they are used to disable parts of your program if you need to remove them temporarily. Here's how you use comments in Ruby:
"","","","","","From now on, I'm going to write code like this. It is important for you to understand that everything does not have to be literal. Your screen and program may visually look different, but what's important is the text you type into the file you're writing in your text editor. In fact, I could work with any text editor and the results would be the same.","","","","",""
"","","","","","Advice from an Old Programmer
"","","","","","You've finished this book and have decided to continue with programming. Maybe it will be a career for you, or maybe it will be a hobby. You'll need some advice to make sure you continue on the right path and get the most enjoyment out of your newly chosen activity.","","","","",""
"","","","","","I've been programming for a very long time. So long that it's incredibly boring to me. At the time that I wrote this book, I knew about 20 programming languages and could learn new ones in about a day to a week depending on how weird they were. Eventually though this just became boring and couldn't hold my interest anymore. This doesn't mean I think programming is boring, or that you will think it's boring, only that I find it uninteresting at this point in my journey.","","","","",""
"","","","","","What I discovered after this journey of learning is that it's not the languages that matter but what you do with them. Actually, I always knew that, but I'd get distracted by the languages and forget it periodically. Now I never forget it, and neither should you.","","","","",""
"","","","","","Which programming language you learn and use doesn't matter. Do not get sucked into the religion surrounding programming languages as that will only blind you to their true purpose of being your tool for doing interesting things.","","","","",""
"","","","","","Programming as an intellectual activity is the only art form that allows you to create interactive art. You can create projects that other people can play with, and you can talk to them indirectly. No other art form is quite this interactive. Movies flow to the audience in one direction. Paintings do not move. Code goes both ways.","","","","",""
"","","","","","Programming as a profession is only moderately interesting. It can be a good job, but you could make about the same money and be happier running a fast food joint. You're much better off using code as your secret weapon in another profession.","","","","",""
"","","","","","People who can code in the world of technology companies are a dime a dozen and get no respect. People who can code in biology, medicine, government, sociology, physics, history, and mathematics are respected and can do amazing things to advance those disciplines.","","","","",""
"","","","","","Of course, all of this advice is pointless. If you liked learning to write software with this book, you should try to use it to improve your life any way you can. Go out and explore this weird, wonderful, new intellectual pursuit that barely anyone in the last 50 years has been able to explore. Might as well enjoy it while you can.","","","","",""
"","","","","","Finally, I'll say that learning to create software changes you and makes you different. Not better or worse, just different. You may find that people treat you harshly because you can create software, maybe using words like "nerd." Maybe you'll find that because you can dissect their logic that they hate arguing with you. You may even find that simply knowing how a computer works makes you annoying and weird to them.","","","","",""
"","","","","","To this I have just one piece of advice: they can go to hell. The world needs more weird people who know how things work and who love to figure it all out. When they treat you like this, just remember that this is your journey, not theirs. Being different is not a crime, and people who tell you it is are just jealous that you've picked up a skill they never in their wildest dreams could acquire.","","","","",""
"","","","","","You can code. They cannot. That is pretty damn cool","","","","",""
"","","","","","Programming Programming","","","","",""
"","","","","","Metaprogramming is the act of writing code that operates on code rather than on data. This involves inspecting and modifying a program as it runs using constructs exposed by the language.","","","","",""
"","","","","","In the example below, here are some of the "meta" changes we're making to the program:","","","","",""
"","","","","","Reopening classes: Add a method named foldl to Ruby's native Array class
Programmatic method invocation: Use send to call a method by name programmatically
The end result is the ability to combine the elements of any array containing any type of object in fairly arbitrary ways.","","","","",""
"","","","","","Metaprogramming is supported across many languages using many different techniques; you’ve probably used some of them already. Here’s a brief list of some popular languages besides Ruby that support metaprogramming in some form.","","","","",""
"","","","","","Lisp via homoiconicity","","","","",""
"","","","","","Java via reflection","","","","",""
"","","","","","C# via reflection","","","","",""
"","","","","","The focus of this book is to demonstrate how metaprogramming happens in Ruby, what its limitations are and what kinds of problems are best solved using it.","","","","",""
"","","","","","This last is pretty important, because metaprogramming is arguably one of the most misused features of the Ruby language. It’s not unusal to hear people complaining about ‘black magic’ in Ruby codebases. This is usually because they, or the author of that codebase, or both didn’t understand metaprogramming.","","","","",""
"","","","","","Learning when metaprogramming is the right tool for the job will be of considerable value to you in creating powerful yet maintainable codebases.","","","","",""
"","","","","","Diving into blocks","","","","",""
"","","","","","Blocks are often the first Ruby-ism that new Rubyists run into, and are confused by. What are blocks? Why do they exist? How do I use them?","","","","",""
"","","","","","I'll do my best to answer all these questions and more in this lesson.","","","","",""
"","","","","","What are blocks?","","","","",""
"","","","","","Blocks aren't unique to Ruby. The official (language agnostic) definition of blocks is "A section of code which is grouped together." Of course, I'm guessing this doesn't help you much.","","","","",""
"","","","","","A simpler way to describe blocks is “A block is code that you can store in a variable like any other object and run on demand.”","","","","",""
"","","","","","Let me help you build a mental model for this by showing you some code, then refactoring it to a block in Ruby. We can start by writing some code that does something trivial, but meaningful.","","","","",""
"","","","","","Maybe add two numbers?","","","","",""
"","","","","","Sweet. That works! However, this only covers the first part of the definition - it's a section of code. It isn't "grouped together" though, nor is it stored in a variable.","","","","",""
"","","","","","Let's work on it some more to make it more generic before we "group it."","","","","",""
"","","","","","Great. That works - we've replaced the numbers with variables. The code that does the addition, however, is still not stored in a variable.","","","","",""
"","","","","","Let's make it happen!","","","","",""
"","","","","","And there you have it all nice and grouped - a block!","","","","",""
"","","","","","The `lambda` keyword is what is most commonly used to create a block in Ruby. There are other ways to do it, but lets keep things simple for now.","","","","",""
"","","","","","At this point if you're thinking "Wait, that looks pretty much like a method, except there's no class or object" then you're absolutely right. Try thinking of it like this: A block is like a method, but one that isn’t associated with any object.","","","","",""
"","","","","","Let’s examine blocks more closely.","","","","",""
"","","","","","Are blocks objects? Yes, like almost everything else in Ruby, they are.","","","","",""
"","","","","","
"","","","","","As you can see, the block we just created has an object_id, belongs to the class Proc (which is what a block is called in Ruby), which is itself a subclass of Object.","","","","",""
"","","","","","We can even flip the definition around and define methods in terms of blocks. A method is simply a block bound to an object, with access to the object's state.","","","","",""
"","","","","","Let me illustrate the idea by reverse engineering a Ruby method to produce a block. Here's a more traditional approach to the previous problem (and please forgive my crappy object modeling):","","","","",""
"","","","","","There, that works as you'd expect. Now lets take it further.","","","","",""
"","","","","","And there you have it - a regular, old fashioned method converted to a fancy-pants block!","","","","",""
"","","","","","It's your turn now! In the next section, we'll expand on this problem with an exercise that gets your feet wet.","","","","",""
"","","","","","What is an object?","","","","",""
"","","","","","Everything in Ruby is an object. All objects have an identity; they can also hold state and manifest behaviour by responding to messages. These messages are normally dispatched through method calls.","","","","",""
"","","","","","A string is an example of a Ruby object. Each string object has its own identity exposed through methods like object_id, == and class. It also has to store the value of the string and thus has state. Methods like split, upcase, downcase exposes the behavior of the object.","","","","",""
"","","","","","But what about a method? Is that an object too? Ruby provides an object representation for methods as well. method(method_name) returns a method object that holds method_name. We cover this in detail in the RubyMonk Metaprogramming: Code Inspection chapter.","","","","",""
"","","","","","Blocks, lambdas, Class - all of the them are objects. Every expression in Ruby evaluates to an object. These are all objects:","","","","",""
"","","","","","Class, Module, Method, Object.new","","","",""
"","","","","","SomeUserDefinedClass.new","","","","",""
"","","","","","Object Identity","","","","",""
"","","","","","The Ruby VM keeps track of every object in memory through the object_id method which is present in all objects in Ruby. Different objects always have different ids.","","","","",""
"","","","","","As you can see in the above example, every time you create the string "a", the object has a new object_id. This means two objects were created for representing "a".","","","","",""
"","","","","","Let us now look at a different aspect of an object's identity: its origin. The class definition from which an object was instantiated is an intrinsic part of its identity. The class method serves this purpose and is present in every object in Ruby. A few examples:","","","","",""
"","","","","","Here Foo is a class definition object - this is where we define the behaviour of all the objects instantiated by the class Foo. What is the class of the class definition itself? Let us take a look at class Foo to find out:","","","","",""
"","","","","","String, Array, Foo - these are all objects that hold class definitions. All such class definitions themselves belongs to the class Class. The class definition objects can instantiate objects of its class.","","","","",""
"","","","","","Here is an exercise that you can solve using the class method. I have a couple of dishes - Soup, IceCream and ChineseGreenBeans (yum!). Objects of these classes can be added to the DeliveryTray.The DeliveryTray has to keep track of the number of dish of each type and suggest how many dishes it needs to carry.","","","","",""
"","","","","","See the Solution","","","","",""
"","","","","","You can check whether an object, say x is an instance of a particular class A by comparing x.class == A. The instance_of? method is a standard Ruby method that is a shorthand for this:","","","","",""
"","","","","","As we can see, even though B inherits from A, Ruby does not consider objects of type B to be instances of A.","","","","",""
"","","","","","In the next lesson we'll go through the behaviour of objects in Ruby.","","","","",""

This thermal control is similar to the system used in a NASA space suit. A small amount of water circulates constantly throughout the bed, via integrated tubing, and warms or cools the bed to the temperature selected by the sleeper. The ChiliBed is made from specially formulated TempXL memory foam. This unique Visco memory foam maintains its firmness and feel across a broad temperature range. This is important as the small amount of water circulating through the top layer of the bed may be adjusted between 46oF and 118°F (8°C and 46°C). The TempXL memory foam used to make the ChiliBed contains soy- and/or other natural oil-based foams, resulting in a significantly greener product. Additionally, all foams integrated into the ChiliBed are specially treated, providing antimicrobial and antifungal benefits. The ChiliBed is revolutionizing sleep quality, as studies continue to confirm the most restful and rejuvenating sleep temperature is between 60°F and 68°F. And for those concerned with energy efficiency, each controller averages only 80 watts. Chili Bed is Efficient For the cost of operating a light bulb, dont you deserve a great night of sleep?

Of course, you should use a mattress protector. Waterproof mattress protectors are best. A zippered cover adds another level of protection in cleanliness. Below are a few hints on how to clean your mattress cover. When you purchase our NATURAL or ALL NATURAL COLLECTIONS ,Wash only the top part (the fabric you sleep on) of the mattress cover. It is likely only the top part that needs to be laundered, and the cover will clean better if it is the only thing in the load. Additionally, do not remove the fire retardant layer that is attached to the latex rubber. Wash in warm or cold water using regular detergent. Be careful not to use harsh stain removers or bleach. Regular laundry detergent will remove most stains if treated according to stain type (proteins, etc). Although air-drying the cover is ideal, you can also use your dryer at its lowest heat setting. Try not to over dry the cover. Replacement covers are available if you may need one. Just contact us directly with any questions.

"","","","","","Unit Testing for the Disinclined","","","","",""
"","","","","","I work with many engineers used to developing software with a traditional waterfall-ish methodology. Mostly it’s a good experience, but it does mean that I spend a lot of my time talking, demonstrating, pleading, begging, threatening, jumping up and down and holding my breath, all in an effort to get folks to write unit tests. Mostly the argument against writing tests is that it is a lot of extra work that is really pretty optional. “I’ll write the tests at the end,” they sometimes say to shut me up, “If I have time.” After all, we spend all day everyday looking at the code, tweaking it, debugging it and running it. Surely that should be enough.","","","","",""
"","","","","","Which brings me to page 328. Of Eloquent Ruby of course. Page 328 is like just about every other page of my latest book, full of breathless prose and numerous coding examples. Writing code for a book is a lot like writing production code, but with a few special twists. It’s like writing production code in that the book code has to work: Hell hath no fury like a reader who has just tried to run an example and found that you missed a comma. Book code is different from regular code in that it doesn’t go into production, it goes onto the page. For Eloquent Ruby, I attacked the twin problems of making sure the code worked and making sure it landed on the page by writing a couple of Ruby scripts. One script runs all of the RSpecs associated with the code to verify that it does indeed work. The other script extracts all of the interesting bits of code (bits that are marked off by special comments) and inserts them into the right places in the manuscript.","","","","",""
"","","","","","Except that I didn’t do that everywhere. There were a few places where the sheer difficulty of writing a working program or simple laziness drove me to write the code directly into the book without the benefits of a spec. There were only a handful of these and during the review phase of writing I made a point of taking a careful look at each one: Gotta check those untested code samples, just to make sure they work. Which brings me back to page 328. Right there in the middle of the page is one of the handful of code examples that I didn’t run through RSpec:","","","","",""
"","","","","","That > should be a <. Putting that > in a class definition is one of my very favorite Ruby syntax mistakes to make. For what it’s worth, my subconscious is convinced that since there is likely to be more stuff in the subclass than in the superclass, it only makes sense that subclass > superclass.","","","","",""
"","","","","","Whatever the dark psychological forces behind it, the fact is that I got that code example wrong. Looking at this statistically, the broken example above is one of  five in the book that is spec-less. That’s a 20% error rate. Now I don’t know what the real error rate is in the other 600-odd examples in the book – after all the book hasn’t been out all that long and there probably are some lurking bugs. But if there was anywhere near 120 coding mistakes in the book (20% of 600) I think I would have heard about it by now. My guess is that that the error rate for the Spec’ed examples is at least an order of magnitude less than for the untested code.","","","","",""
"","","","","","Now step back and think about this with me. I got the Automobile example wrong even though it contained a glaring mistake. I got it wrong even though the mistake was one that I know I make. I got it wrong  even though I took some extra time to eye-ball it to make sure it was right. I got it wrong while I got most, if not all, of the other 600 examples, the ones with RSpecs, right.  If that doesn’t convince you of the utility of unit testing, well, I’m just going to hold my breath till I turn blue.","","","","",""
"","","","","","You're not a programmer quite yet. I like to think of this book as giving you your "programming black belt." You know enough to start another book on programming and handle it just fine. This book should have given you the mental tools and attitude you need to go through most Ruby books and actually learn something. It might even make it easy.","","","","",""
"","","","","","I recommend you check out some of these projects and try to build something with them:","","","","",""
"","","","","","Pick one of the above resources, and go through any tutorials and documentation they have. As you go through documentation with code in it, type in all of the code and make it work. That's how I do it. That's how every programmer does it. Reading programming documentation is not enough to learn it; you have to do it. After you get through the tutorial and any other documentation they have, make something. Anything will do, even something someone else has already written. Just make something.","","","","",""

"","","","","","How to Learn Any Programming Language","","","","",""
"","","","","","I'm going to teach you how to learn most of the programming languages you may want to learn in the future. The organization of this book is based on how I and many other programmers learn new languages. The process that I usually follow is:","","","","",""
"","","","","","Get a book or some introductory text about the language.","","","","",""
"","","","","","Go through the book and type in all of the code making all of it run.","","","","",""
"","","","","","Read the book as you work on the code, taking notes.","","","","",""
"","","","","","Use the language to implement a small set of programs you are familiar with in another language.","","","","",""
"","","","","","Read other people's code in the language, and try to copy their patterns.","","","","",""
"","","","","","In this book, I forced you to go through this process very slowly and in small chunks. Other books aren't organized the same way and this means you have to extrapolate how I've made you do this to how their content is organized. Best way to do this is to read the book lightly and make a list of all the major code sections. Turn this list into a set of exercises based on the chapters and then simply do them in order one at a time.","","","","",""
"","","","","","The above process also works for new technologies, assuming they have books you can read. For anything without books, you do the above process but use online documentation or source code as your initial introduction.","","","","",""
"","","","","","Each new language you learn makes you a better programmer, and as you learn more they become easier to learn. By your third or fourth language you should be able to pick up similar languages in a week, with stranger languages taking longer. Now that you know Ruby you could potentially learn Python and JavaScript fairly quickly by comparison. This is simply because many languages share similar concepts and once you learn the concepts in one language they work in others.","","","","",""
"","","","","","The final thing to remember about learning a new language is: Don't be a stupid tourist. A stupid tourist is someone who goes to another country and then complains that the food isn't like the food at home. "Why can't I get a good burger in this stupid country!?" When you're learning a new language, assume that what it does isn't stupid, it's just different, and embrace it so you can learn it.","","","","",""
"","","","","","After you learn a language though, don't be a slave to that language's way of doing things. Sometimes the people who use a language actually do some very idiotic things for no other reason than "that's how we've always done it." If you like your style better and you know how everyone else does it, then feel free to break their rules if it improves things.","","","","",""
"","","","","","I really enjoy learning new programming languages. I think of myself as a "programmer anthropologist" and think of them as little insights about the group of programmers who use them. I'm learning a language they all use to talk to each other through computers and I find this fascinating. Then again I'm kind of a weird guy so just learn programming languages because you want to.","","","","",""

"","","","","","Type in each sample exactly.","","","","",""
"","","","","","Make it run.","","","","",""
"","","","","","That's it. This will be very difficult at first, but stick with it. If you go through this book, and do each exercise for one or two hours a night, you will have a good foundation for moving onto another book about Ruby to continue your studies. This book won't turn you into a programmer overnight, but it will get you started on the path to learning how to code.","","","","",""
"","","","","","This book's job is to teach you the three most essential skills that a beginning programmer needs to know: reading and writing, attention to detail, and spotting differences.","","","","",""
"","","","","","Reading and Writing","","","","",""
"","","","","","If you have a problem typing, you will have a problem learning to code, and especially if you have a problem typing the fairly odd characters in source code. Without this simple skill you will be unable to learn even the most basic things about how software works.","","","","",""
"","","","","","Typing the code samples and getting them to run will help you learn the names of the symbols, get familiar with typing them, and get you reading the language.","","","","",""
"","","","","","Attention to Detail","","","","",""
"","","","","","The one skill that separates bad programmers from good programmers is attention to detail. In fact, it's what separates the good from the bad in any profession. You must pay attention to the tiniest details of your work or you will miss important elements of what you create. In programming, this is how you end up with bugs and difficult-to-use systems.","","","","",""
"","","","","","By going through this book, and copying each example exactly, you will be training your brain to focus on the details of what you are doing, as you are doing it.","","","","",""
"","","","","","Spotting Differences","","","","",""
"","","","","","A very important skill (that most programmers develop over time) is the ability to visually notice differences between things. An experienced programmer can take two pieces of code that are slightly different and immediately start pointing out the differences. Programmers have invented tools to make this even easier, but we won't be using any of these. You first have to train your brain the hard way, then use the tools.","","","","",""
"","","","","","While you do these exercises, typing each one in, you will be making mistakes. It's inevitable; even seasoned programmers would make a few. Your job is to compare what you have written to what's required, and fix all the differences. By doing so, you will train yourself to notice mistakes, bugs, and other problems.","","","","",""
"","","","","","Do Not Copy-Paste","","","","",""
"","","","","","You must type each of these exercises in, manually. If you copy and paste, you might as well not even do them. The point of these exercises is to train your hands, your brain, and your mind in how to read, write, and see code. If you copy-paste, you are cheating yourself out of the effectiveness of the lessons.","","","","",""
"","","","","","Using the Included Videos","","","","",""
"","","","","","Learn Ruby The Hard Way has more than 5 hours of instructional videos to help you with the book. There is one video for each exercise where I either demonstrate the exercise, or give you tips for completing the exercise. The best way to use the videos is to attempt or complete the exercises without them first, then use the videos to review what you learned or if you are stuck. This will slowly wean you off of using videos to learn programming and build your skills at understanding code directly. Stick with it, and slowly you won't need the videos, or any videos to learn programming. You'll be able to just read for the information you need.","","","","",""
"","","","","","A Note on Practice and Persistence","","","","",""
"","","","","","While you are studying programming, I'm studying how to play guitar. I practice it every day for at least two hours a day. I play scales, chords, and arpeggios for an hour and then learn music theory, ear training, songs, and anything else I can. Some days I study guitar and music for eight hours because I feel like it and it's fun. To me repetitive practice is natural and just how to learn something. I know that to get good at anything you have to practice every day, even if I suck that day (which is often) or it's difficult. Keep trying and eventually it'll be easier and fun.","","","","",""
"","","","","","Between the time that I wrote Learn Python The Hard Way and Learn Ruby The Hard Way I discovered drawing and painting. I fell in love with making visual art at the age of 39 and have been spending every day studying it in much the same way that I studied guitar, music, and programming. I collected books of instructional material, did what the books said, painted every day, and focused on enjoying the process of learning. I am by no means an "artist", or even that good, but I can now say that I can draw and paint. The same method I'm teaching you in this book applied to my adventures in art. If you break the problem down into small exercises and lessons, and do them every day, you can learn to do almost anything. If you focus on slowly improving and enjoying the learning process, then you will benefit no matter how good you are at it.","","","","",""
"","","","","","As you study this book, and continue with programming, remember that anything worth doing is difficult at first. Maybe you are the kind of person who is afraid of failure so you give up at the first sign of difficulty. Maybe you never learned self-discipline so you can't do anything that's "boring." Maybe you were told that you are "gifted" so you never attempt anything that might make you seem stupid or not a prodigy. Maybe you are competitive and unfairly compare yourself to someone like me who's been programming for more than 20 years.","","","","",""
"","","","","","Whatever your reason for wanting to quit, keep at it. Force yourself. If you run into a Study Drill you can't do, or a lesson you just do not understand, then skip it and come back to it later. Just keep going because with programming there's this very odd thing that happens. At first, you will not understand anything. It'll be weird, just like with learning any human language. You will struggle with words, and not know what symbols are what, and it'll all be very confusing. Then one day BANG your brain will snap and you will suddenly "get it." If you keep doing the exercises and keep trying to understand them, you will get it. You might not be a master coder, but you will at least understand how programming works.","","","","",""
"","","","","","If you give up, you won't ever reach this point. You will hit the first confusing thing (which is everything at first) and then stop. If you keep trying, keep typing it in, trying to understand it and reading about it, you will eventually get it. If you go through this whole book, and you still do not understand how to code, at least you gave it a shot. You can say you tried your best and a little more and it didn't work out, but at least you tried. You can be proud of that.","","","","",""

"","","","","","Sometimes people who already know a programming language will read this book and feel I'm insulting them. There is nothing in this book that is intended to be interpreted as condescending, insulting, or belittling. I simply know more about programming than my intended readers.
