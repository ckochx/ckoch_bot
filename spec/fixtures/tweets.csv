"","","","","","Eco-Pedic Deluxe 13-inch Memory Foam Mattress The Eco-Pedic Deluxe 13-inch memory foam is an environmentally friendly bed choice that compares in construction to the 13-inch National Brand memory foam mattress. Our Eco-friendly memory foam offers a superior alternative to the hydrocarbon-based memory foam used in the National Brand memory foam mattress. The memory foam we use for our exclusive Eco-Pedic is hypoallergenic, anti-microbial and naturally dust mite, mold and mildew resistant. It also provides a superior sleeping surface with contouring support, pressure relief and outstanding heat dissipating characteristics. The high performance plant-based foam support layer offers extraordinary comfort and unparalleled orthopedic support. The core support layer is a high-grade (anti-microbial) botanic bio-foam. The extra strong support base will ensure that the bed never sags or flattens out. The inviting quilting on this deluxe mattress is made from bamboo fibers. Not only is bamboo a renewable resource (perhaps the most renewable plant resource) but these high-quality textiles are also downy soft. The Deluxe quilting is done in a waterfall edge with the bamboo material wrapping down the sides of the mattress to meet with the ultra suede used on the lower sides of the mattress. The suede sides provide outstanding mattress protection. Eco-Pedic foundations are specially designed to properly support the mattress and in turn offer a perfect surface to gently relax you into deep and restful sleep. These artisan built bases provide better than a traditional box spring. An Eco-Pedic mattress foundation requires a different construction method than a traditional box spring and it is important to pair your memory foam mattress with a purpose built foundation. Our exclusive eco-conscious memory foam is a superior bedding product that is firm yet breathable and promotes an anatomically correct sleep posture for deep, healthy, restful and restorative sleep. An Eco-Pedic Deluxe bed offers you comparable support and construction to the National Brand but at a fraction of the cost.

We designed our Eco-Pedic mattresses using non-off-gassing Eco-friendly slow-response plant-based memory foam and fast-response bio-foam, also made from a plant-derived compound. The eco memory foam used in our Eco-Pedic beds is also an extremely breathable memory foam that does not act as body-heat trap, unlike old line traditional memory foam. While the sleep-feel of an original memory foam mattress is highly desirable, one of the biggest complaints centers around the mattress -insleeping hot-in due to their heat-retaining properties. Off-gassing is a second major complaint about traditional memory foam. By changing the formulation of our memory foam, we have ben able to eliminate the intense chemical smell that can plague a new memory foam mattress for up to 3 months!

Set the temperature using the control unit or by wireless remote while in bed. ChiliBed can be configured for single or dual zone climate control. Dual-zone provides independent control for each side of the bed so sleepers can find their own preferred temperature. The control units use only 80W of energy on average. Save on utility costs by cooling or heating your bed at night instead of your entire house! Easy set up. Simple to maintain.

This thermal control is similar to the system used in a NASA space suit. A small amount of water circulates constantly throughout the bed, via integrated tubing, and warms or cools the bed to the temperature selected by the sleeper. The ChiliBed is made from specially formulated TempXL memory foam. This unique Visco memory foam maintains its firmness and feel across a broad temperature range. This is important as the small amount of water circulating through the top layer of the bed may be adjusted between 46oF and 118°F (8°C and 46°C). The TempXL memory foam used to make the ChiliBed contains soy- and/or other natural oil-based foams, resulting in a significantly greener product. Additionally, all foams integrated into the ChiliBed are specially treated, providing antimicrobial and antifungal benefits. The ChiliBed is revolutionizing sleep quality, as studies continue to confirm the most restful and rejuvenating sleep temperature is between 60°F and 68°F. And for those concerned with energy efficiency, each controller averages only 80 watts. Chili Bed is Efficient For the cost of operating a light bulb, dont you deserve a great night of sleep?

Washing: Please do NOT use any bleach, bleach alternatives, non-chlorine bleach or any bleach by-products in the detergent, as this will destroy the polyurethane lining. The protector can be washed in hot water. Do NOT dry clean Drying: Please dry together with some other bed linen or towels. The protector can be tumble dried on a medium heat for about 40 minutes (longer if needed - depending on your dryer) Careful drying will prevent blistering of the lining. If blisters do form from overheating of the dryer, please discontinue using the protector, as these blisters will split open and lead to the protector leaking.","","","","",""

"","","","","","Eco Ultimate Organic Natural Latex Mattress You're exhausted at the end of the day and all you want to do is sink into your mattress and disappear into dreamland. But you've been experiencing a lot of sniffles, sneezing, itching and you're not sleeping well on the mattress you just got a while ago. What's wrong? It's not allergy season and this mattress was supposed to be top of the line... Some people have allergies to the flame retardants used in manufacturing mattresses. The furniture store you went to -inforgot-in to mention that there's chemicals sprayed on and inside the mattress you just bought. Maybe the salesperson also forgot to mention how that cheaply made but overpriced mattress doesn't give your body the kind of support it needs to feel rested. No more! The Eco Ultimate Organic mattress gives you the perfect amount of support for the most restful sleep without the irritating allergies or sensitivities to the traditional manufacturing process. It's one of the very first truly organic mattress models available.

Very comfortable and warm due to the pure wool fibers, yet breathable because of the cotton fibers you barely need a blanket or comforter even in the colder months! The bulk of your new mattress is typically made from the dunlop latex, a dense, body supporting latex foam replacement that's all natural and contains no fire retardant chemicals and no synthetic fibers of any kind. This is an excellent fiber, similar to memory foam, that holds its shape even when youngsters are using the mattress as a trampoline.

Pile fabrics may require brushing with a non-metallic, stiff bristle brush to restore appearance. Hot water extraction or steam cleaning is not a recommended cleaning method. To prevent overall soiling, frequent vacuuming or light brushing with a non-metallic, stiff bristle brush to remove dust and grime is recommended. When cleaning a spill, blot immediately to remove spilled material. Clean spots or stains from the outside to the middle of the affected area to prevent circling. Use a professional furniture cleaning service when an overall soiled condition is apparent.

All types of food scraps can be composted including: Meat, Fish, Vegies, Fruit, Dairy, Coffee, Wilted Flowers (no bones or excessive liquids). 2. Spray with Compost Accelerator-- The Compost Accelerator Spray replaces messy Bokashi Bran in the Urban Composter. Urban Composter Compost Accelerator is sprayed on to the scraps which assists the break down and fermentation of the scraps in the bucket. The Urban Composter composts using an anerobic composting process which means that the food scraps don’t rot or smell while breaking down. 3. Drain the bucket every couple of days-- Draining the Urban Composter Bucket is an essential part of bokashi composting. As the scraps ferment, liquids are released. This juice – which is saturated in good bacteria and nutrients – can be drained from the bucket every few days. This can be used as an excellent fertilizer for plants, or can be flushed down drains as it promotes septic systems. 4. Mix with soil-- The scraps will break down in approx 4-8 weeks. Once the bucket is full, and all the liquid drained, the pulp can be added to soil. It can be: buried in the garden, in a pot or planter of soil, added to outdoor composting or to worm farms. Urban Composter is a revolutionary kitchen bokashi/composting bin that composts your kitchen scraps and turns it into nutrient-rich garden fertilizer. The Urban Composter Bucket solves the problem of bokashi composting in the kitchen. The stylish design of the Urban Composter Bucket is right at home in any home or kitchen. Urban Composter is available in full-size (4-gallon) and city-size (1.7-gallon). The Urban Composter Bucket is designed to replace traditional kitchen scrap containers for larger families. You get all the benefits of bokashi composting without leaving the kitchen, and without the mess and smell. The Urban Composter Buckets provide a stylish composting system that you’d be proud to show-off on your kitchen countertop. The new Urban Composter City bucket has been completely redesigned with apartment living in mind. Some families don’t need the large capacity of the 15 liter (4-gallon) Urban Composter Bucket, so the smaller City bucket provides the same bokashi composting features in a handy 6 Litre capacity. Small enough for confined kitchens, or under the kitchen counter, if you wish. Compost Accelerator Bokashi Spray for the Urban Composter Bucket and Urban Composter City, comes in a handy 500mL refill bottle. Clean and Simple Compost Accelerator Spray. The secret to the Urban Composter is the revolutionary Compost Accelerator spray. This uniquely formulated spray contains Effective Microbes (EM1) that break down your leftover food, kitchen peelings and other organic waste. Easier to use than traditional bokashi bran, the Compost Accelerator spray comes in a 500 mL bottle that is clean, quick and simple to use.","","","","",""
"","","","","","Urban Composter City 1.7 Gallon A fast & revolutionary way to compost kitchen food waste. Throw the food inside, spray, close the lid and leave. Fast breakdown, without the use of oxygen, ensures smells are kept to a minimum; the tight-fitting lid ensures no spills or flies.

Less mess than a bokashi bucket, and much less complicated than a wormery Urban Composter uses a natural probiotic spray to speed up the break down of scraps, including meat & fish.

Eloquent. Balanced. The Oasis 700 – NR is a very special shower head that was designed to look nothing like the lower-end brands. It is beautiful, eloquent, and perfectly balanced. This soft downpour design was created with the idea of bringing a truly luxurious and high quality bathroom necessity at an extremely affordable price.

One attribute of this shower head that makes it especially unique is the simplicity of its visual design. At first glance, it is a simple bell shape, yet this simplicity evokes a certain sense of elegance of design that has been largely lost in the mainstream shower industry over the last several decades. This structural layout is accentuated by the refined brushed nickel finish that gives this shower head a subtly classic appearance, while the outer round edge extends just beyond the nozzles to create a very crisp finish. The Visual Appeal. The visual appeal; however, tells only half of the story, because underneath the classic bell shaped design is a high quality ABS construction that enhances the stability and durability of this model, and easily surpasses lower end brands (which are oftentimes designed to look pretty, but have terrible quality). Installing this shower head is a breeze, as it comes with a standard ½” – 14 NPT connection and the shower head works perfectly well with straight as well as angled shower arms. The self clean nozzles prevent mineral build up so that your shower head keeps you happy longer without the need for unnecessary maintenance. At the same time, the solid brass swivel ball assembly makes this a very sturdy unit that is easily adjustable to the desired angle, without the need for any special assembly.

FEATURES & FUNCTIONS 8-in Square Full Body Rainshower system Single function full body shower Solid Stainless Steel construction Soft downpour of Luxury spa spray Beautiful Polished Chrome finish face create a bright, reflective look Luxury Brushed finish 144 White high pressure nozzle Self-Clean Nozzles prohibit mineral build-up Solid Brass swivel ball assembly Works with both straight and angled standard shower arms Standard 1/2-in - 14 NPT connection for easy installation Limited to 2.5 gpm (9.5 L/min) Max at 80 psi Net weight : 2.0lb Gross weight : 2.5lb 8-in Square Solid Stainless Steel Rainshower Head with Polished Finish To increase longevity of this unit, this shower head was built with a high quality stainless steel construction that is meant to last. It has a solid brass swivel ball assembly that allows for seamless shower head adjustment with minimal effort. Furthermore, this model works well with straight or angled standard shower arms and has a standard 1/2-in - 14 NPT connection, which makes installation simple and straightforward. Maintenance of this model is simple because of self cleaning nozzles that were designed to prevent mineral build-up that can distort water flow in lower end shower heads. Durable. Keeping durability in mind, this shower head was manufactured with quality materials. The quality ABS construction was used to increase sturdiness, while the solid brass swivel ball assembly was implemented for added durability and ease of use. Self cleaning nozzles were used in the model to prevent mineral build up that can quickly ruin the ability of lower-end brands to apply water flow evenly throughout the surface of your body. Self clean nozzles are a good way to save you time, and keep your shower head going longer at full capacity without the need for extensive maintenance. Furthermore, the Oasis 700 – SS is easy to install because it comes with a standard 1/2-in - 14 NPT connection, and works great with straight as well as angled shower arms. Modern appearance that blends in with any bathroom decor. Visually, this shower head model has a distinctly modern appearance, but one that is still muted and blends in well with any bathroom dÃ©cor. In this particular model, a polished chrome finish was used to enhance the elegance of this shower head without creating an “over the top” glossy look. It is a perfect example of elegance through simplicity and restraint. It is a visual elegance that is perfectly complemented by the soft downpour of water that simply cannot be experienced with cheaper brands, because this model was designed to feel as if you were taking a shower in the rain. With cheaper alternatives, however, you might as well be showering with a garden hose and a bucket. 1 YEAR LIMITED WARRANTY. 100% coverage. Bio Bidet values your business and always attempts to provide you the very best of service. OASIS Rainshower Heads come with 100% warranty coverage for 1 full years from date of purchase.

A thing of beauty and durability. This shower head was designed to work with straight and angled shower arms; making it easy to install without a hassle. The solid stainless steel construction was used to add sturdiness and durability, while the solid brass swivel ball assembly provides for easy angle adjustment after installation.

Research shows that an important key to comfort is how your pillow interacts with your mattress and your body to influence correct alignment and relief of pressure. Dust mites, mold and mildew build up to unhealthy levels in pillows more than a year old which should be replaced for uninterrupted sleep. Here are some factors you need to keep in mind when choosing the right pillow for you: Pillows keep the spine aligned. It is very important to maintain the natural neck curve when you are sleeping. If the pillow is too high, your neck could be bent too much forward or to the side, causing muscle strain on the back of the neck and shoulders. This could also cause narrowing of the air way and obstructed breathing. If the pillow is too low, the neck muscles can also be strained. The right pillow depends on your body type, and should properly support your head and neck. Pillows are comfortable. A large part of what makes a good pillow is personal preference. If the pillow feels comfortable, its likely to help you relax, get a good night’s sleep, and feel well rested in the morning. Pillows are adjustable. Pillows should be adjustable enough to fit your individual needs. A pillow should mold to your shape and alleviate any pressure points. Available Sizes","","","","",""
